I am in the process of learning Java with a focus on System Design and Software Architecture. My primary goal is to understand how Java can be applied effectively in these areas, especially for those with experience in other programming languages who are just starting to learn Java.
To support this, Iâ€™ve created a repository to share the resources and materials I am working through. This repository aims to help those who are new to Java but have a background in software engineering, system design, architecture, and security.
The content is organized into four main sections:
<br>
**Software Engineering** - Key concepts and best practices in software development using Java.
**System Design** - Exploring system design patterns, scalability, and how to implement them in Java.
**Architecture** - Understanding Java's role in building robust and scalable architectures.
**Security** - Focusing on secure coding practices, encryption, and other security considerations within Java applications.
I hope this repository will be useful for anyone transitioning to Java from other programming languages, and will serve as a helpful resource for learning and applying Java in these key areas.
